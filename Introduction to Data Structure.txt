                                     Introduction to Data Structures

A Data Structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

We talk about data Structures as :

1).Mathematical / logical models
            or 
    Abstract data types

Example of ADT :-
    
    List
-store a given number of elements of any type.
-read elements by position.
-modify element at a position.

2).Implementation

Example:
  Arrays - Concrete Implementation
  LinkedList

Abstract Data Types:- Define data and operations but no implementation : Arrays, LinkedList, Trees, Graph

We will study the following :
1). Logical view
2). operations
3). Cost of operations
4). Impmlementation
